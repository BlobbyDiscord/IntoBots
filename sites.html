        <p>Our free website program for Discord bot owners will be going out of effect on May 15th. We are going to stop offering free services, and instead replace them for paid services.</p>
        <p>
            <b>existing website owners:</b>
            <br><br>
            If you have a website for your Discord bot that was made by disgd, your website will still be active with your disgd domain name and hosting for free.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>bot owners in queue for websites:</b>
            <br><br>
            If you applied for a disgd website and were accepted, your website will still be made for free and have hosting, but long wait times may occur due to queue backup or other reasons. If you want a website sooner, then contact Akira#4587 asking to buy a front position in the queue.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>bot owners who's application has not been accepted yet:</b>
            <br><br>
            If you applied for a disgd website and have not been accepted or denied yet, you will still be eligible for a free website. Read the section above if you get accepted. If you are denied, then you may not apply again for a free disgd website.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>bot owners who have not appliet yet:</b>
            <br><br>
            <u>We are accepting applications until May 15th.</u> After that time period, free disgd webstie applications will be closed.
